### Hi, I'm Hoda. 👋

- 👩🏻‍🏫 I am a physics PhD student at the University of Florida, working in the field of computational (Theoretical) Biophysics, a member of the Dixit Lab. 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on two projects, a generative model for protein sequences and an information theoretic formulation to quantify cell-signaling quality in cells. Manuscripts for both projects are in preparation.
- 🌱 I’m evolving my coding skills constantly (it's the job), I mainly use Python but have been learning alot about bash recently and I am loving it for editing text files. The sed command is so powerful! I am currently learning about Quantum Computing through the book [Quantum Country: Quantum Computing for the Very Curious](https://quantum.country) by Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen.
- 👯 I’m up to collaborate on any machine learning project, I've done a few on my own but love a new challenge.
- 📫 How to reach me: hodaakl@ufl.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: My last name "AKL" "عقل" is arabic for "mind" but the way native English speakers pronounce it makes it sound more like the arabic word for "Food". (I think that's a little funny)
