### Hi, I'm Hoda. 👋

- 👩🏻‍🏫 I am a physics PhD student at the University of Florida, working in the field of computational Biophysics in [Dixit group](https://sites.google.com/view/dixitlab). 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on two projects, [a generative model for protein sequences](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.12.520114v1) and an [information theoretic formulation to quantify cell-signaling quality in cells](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR22/Session/Q04.7). 
- 🌱 I am currently learning about Transfomers and how language models are applied to protein sequeneces. 
- 👯 I’m up to collaborate on machine learning projects.
- 🙏🏼 I'm always happy to receive feedback on how to make my code better. If you try to apply any of my code and face difficulty, please reach out!
