### Hi, I'm Hoda. 👋
- 👩🏻‍🏫 I am a machine learning scientist at Generate: Biomedicines. 
- 👩🏻‍🏫 I did my physics PhD student at the University of Florida, working in the field of computational Biophysics in [Dixit group](https://sites.google.com/view/dixitlab). 
- 🔭 My main work in my PhD revolved around the theme of approximate density estimation through probabilistic models. I worked on a [a generative model for protein sequences](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.12.520114v1) and an [information theoretic formulation to quantify cell-signaling quality in cells](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR22/Session/Q04.7) among other projects.
- 🌱 I am broadly very interested in Machine Learning for protein design and environmental applications. 
- 🙏🏼 I'm always happy to receive feedback on how to make my code better. If you try to apply any of my code and face difficulty, please reach out!

- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: My last name "AKL" is Arabic for "mind/wisdom/consciousness", it is pretty hard to pronouse, and is commonly misprounounced. Interesting, the mis-pronounciation is another word in Arabic, and it is "food", and my passion for food is very much real.
