### Hi, I'm Hoda. 👋

- 👩🏻‍🏫 I am a physics PhD student at the University of Florida, working in the field of computational (Theoretical) Biophysics in [Dixit Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/dixitlab). 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on two projects, [a generative model for protein sequences](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR22/Session/K06.8) and an [information theoretic formulation to quantify cell-signaling quality in cells](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR22/Session/Q04.7). Manuscripts for both projects are in preparation.
- 🌱 I’m always learning how to code better, I mainly use Python but have been learning alot about bash recently and I am loving it for editing text files. The sed command is so powerful! I am currently learning about Quantum Computing through the book [Quantum Country: Quantum Computing for the Very Curious](https://quantum.country) by Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen.
- 👯 I’m up to collaborate on any machine learning project, I've done a few on my own but love a new challenge.
- 🙏🏼 I'm always happy to receive feedback on how to make my code better. If you try to apply any of my code and face difficulty, please reach out!

- ⚡ Fun fact: My last name "AKL" is Arabic for "mind" but the way native English speakers pronounce it, it sounds more like Arabic for "Food" (I think that's funny, but maybe that's just me.).
